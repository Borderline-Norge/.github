# Borderline Norge

Borderline Norge is a volunteer organization that supports individuals diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) or Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD), along with their families, professionals, and other interested parties.

## Mission
We work to raise awareness about BPD, advocate for better treatment options, and fight to improve the quality of life for people with the disorder. Through our community efforts, we aim to:

- Promote education and understanding of the diagnosis and treatment.
- Advocate for improved services and legal rights for those affected.
- Combat stigma associated with personality disorders.

## How We Help
- **Local Support Groups**: We organize local events, including workshops and social activities, for people with BPD and their loved ones.
- **Information and Resources**: We provide up-to-date information on treatment options, coping strategies, and support networks.
- **Advocacy**: We engage with policymakers to push for better mental health services and greater awareness of BPD in Norway.
